%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Medical researchers are actively using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on neural pathways. This research will not only lead to more reliable and early diagnosis of these diseases, but also a better understanding of how they affect the brain. To help address the challenges in this domain, we introduce a visual analytics system based on DTI fiber tract data and their statistics. Our design exploits synergy between predictive modeling and interactive visualization to overcome several challenges, including the interplay of multi-dimensional features, multiple regions and time-varying data. To determine which features, regions and subjects have a significant dependency with Parkinson's Disease (PD), state of the art machine learning methods are used to rank statistical features, individual brain regions and subjects from large spaces of possibilities.
%State of the art machine learning methods are used to find and rank statistical indicators that effects subjects' brain regions from large spaces of possibilities.
We couple these methods with direct fiber rendering and interactive information visualizations so that one can find the detailed physical manifestations within the brain that are underlying the statistical features. We conduct several case studies using large sets of DTI and T1 images from the research database of Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative.%
