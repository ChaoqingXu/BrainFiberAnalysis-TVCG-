%\subsection{Background Concepts}

%Machine Learning (ML) is an interdisciplinary field of computer science and multivariate statistics, aiming at detecting the patterns in data automatically that can be used to predict about new data through computer programs in building models. To estimate the predictive ability of ML models and prevent from overfitting, corss-validation has been developed in which researchers trained subset of the input data and then test the model with the complimentary subset of the data. 

%1. a predictive system: regions, features
%3. physical structures

%A. Compiling a list of variables for tests of statistical resilience based on experienced-driven hypotheses leaves out other variables in the data which potentially interact with a disease. B. a hypothesis is derived from observations made by clinicians in their daily routine. C. statistical tests on variables associated to a hypothesis yield a value for deciding whether the data supports the hypothesis. Variables not included int he analysis may potentially support the chosen hypothesis by discriminating the population in the expected way, but are not highlighted.D. analyzing the data without prior hypothesis requires a starting point giving an overview over the data. E. With the present XX approaches they were quickly able to confirm medical knowledge and to elaborate new hypotheses. F. Our research has demonstrated that an exploratory interface that can flexibly link different aspects of the data, even if they aren't given with respect to exactly the same domain, can help swiftly identify new and possibly promising research hypotheses.G. Due to the amount of data and only limited overview visualization, possible correlations may be missed. They mostly highlight correlations between features, which are known to the domain experts(eg. correlation between XX and YY).H. Clinicians derive hypotheses via clinical observation, experimental studies or literature research. 


%Detection of neurodegenerative disease has been an important problem for neuroscientists. Misdiagnosis will lead to serious consequences on a person's health and delayed diagnosis can cause serious harm to patients. Therefore, scientists have done a lot of researches, chemically, physically and statistically, on the exploration of neurodegenerative disease. Take PD as an example, it is widely accepted that PD characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the SN region and the effects lately spread to the whole brain. Researchers have been able to successfully distinguish between healthy and unhealthy brain groups through the use of multiple DTI statistics and fiber tract characteristics. More recently, researchers are trying to understand the disease progression through measuring alterations of the fiber integrity of specific brain region.

% \subsection{Limitation of Current Neurodegenerative Disease Analysis and Motivation of Our Work}

% The motivation of our work derived from the limitations of the current disease analysis works which are mainly reflected in three aspects: 
% (1) The limited overview visualization for the exploration of neurodegenerative disease. %(it is hard to find the significant microstructure differences between. especially the analysis of features of physical space, overview visualization). 
% (2) The limitation caused by large-scale features that extracted and analyzed in physical space. %(which region and feature has significant influence on neurodegenerative disease). (contradictory research results). 
% (3) The limitation of experience-driven hypotheses in the detection of neurodegenerative disease. %(that derived from  (hypothesis generation of neurologist, they always derive hypotheses via experimental studies and observations). 
% We will briefly describe each point and justify the necessity of our work. 

% Nucleus basalis region has bee regarded as the first damaged area in the brain in PD. Both statistics and physical structures in the nucleus basalis region have been detected and analyzed\cite{zhang2015diffusion, wei2016combined}. Other regions, such as putamen, palladum, and cingulum regions, have been reported that they would be used to distinguish between PD and NC. The interconnecting fibers between cingulum, temporal lobe, and frontal lobe are main sites of atrophy and damage of PD\cite{aarabi2015statistical}. Moreover, studies indicate a pattern of Parkinson’s disease that early left hemisphere, late right hemisphere with posterior cortical atrophy\cite{claassen2016cortical}. People found that neurodegenerative diseases not only affect a specific region of the brain but also spread to the whole brain\cite{olde2013disrupted}. Researchers find a significant difference in whole-brain scale between healthy and unhealthy groups through neural networks analysis\cite{yau2018network,fujiwara2017visual}. Not only physical structures but also statistical tests on variables that associated with brain regions have been reported to have a great impact on neurodegenerative disease\cite{surova2013assessment, wen2016white}. However, meta-analysis studies sometimes come to contradictory conclusions\cite{zhang2015diffusion, wen2016white}. It is still unclear about the causes and the meaningful differences in the physical structures for distinguishing the degenerative diseases. It is lack of the understanding of the variable changes and the affected neurological pathways changes in the disease progression. Thence, there's a need for an overview visualization of physical structures and multi-variables that could provide researchers an in-depth understanding of the disease in whole brain as well as in different time steps.

% For the exploration of neurodegenerative disease, neurologists typically focus on specific brain regions and specific diffusion tensor measurements. However, the whole brain can be divided into dozens or even hundreds of functional regions and there will have a few of diffusion tensor measurements that could be calculated for in-depth exploration of the disease. Beside of diffusion tensor measurements, arterial spin labeling\cite{wei2016combined}, magnetic susceptibility perturbations\cite{acosta2016whole}, iron\cite{ward2014role}.etc. have also been reported to have a great influence on neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, a few studies that have been published have shown that the incidence of Parkinson’s disease varies by age, gender, and race/ethnicity\cite{van2003incidence}. Fiber number and fiber density have been taken into account as indices for identifying neurodegenerative disease\cite{wei2016combined, grealish2014human}. Due to the complexity of physical structures in a human's brain and the diversity of indices for distinguishing neurodegenerative disease, the size of features that can be extracted from the whole brain for disease analysis would be extremely large. It can be difficult to distinguish which features are meaningful for distinguishing the brain disease from those caused by other factors. 

% Generally, neuroscientists derive hypothesis via their observation, experimental studies or literature research. Based on the previous research, researchers have made a hypothesis that high-resolution neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging could provide indirect measurements of microstructural changes in nigrostriatal and verified the hypothesis by brain regions of interest analysis and statistical analysis\cite{kamagata2016neurite}. Based on the studies of structural connectivity of mid-brain, researchers hypothesized that the damage to fiber tracts connecting the nucleus basalis of Meynert to the cerebral cortex may lead to visual hallucinations in PD \cite{hepp2017damaged}. Moreover, the observations of Gastrointestinal symptoms have led to the hypothesis that the initial causes of PD may not in the brain\cite{hill2017parkinson}. Though those experience-driven hypotheses yield a value for detecting neurodegenerative disease, only a small subset of factors can be concurrently analyzed and other potential factors may be ignored. It is of necessity to provide a workflow for automatically identify correlations among a plenty of factors that potentially affect neurodegenerative disease. 





%It is also known that nucleus basalis region is the first damaged area in the brain. Some experts explored fiber tracts connecting nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and cerebral cortex were damaged in PD [22]. Substantial Nigra, Putamen and palladum are known as the first structures that damaged in PD brain [56]. It is recognized to be a brain-wide neurodegenerative process that spreads up from brainstem into cortex, as originally suggested by Braak [66]. The effects of Parkinson’s disease were observed at a whole-brain scale. By using the magnetoencephalography (MEG), researchers found the network organization is shifted to a random structure that representing the brain goes to a more random efficient state [40]. Significant effects were also observed in the whole Parkinson’s disease brain with spatial distribution of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) [4]. Son [58] obtained fiber tracts of associate cortex-thalamus connection and find the increased number of fiber connecting the region between PD and NC group. Also, they identify three regions (associative cotex, globus pallidus, and putamen regions) that can be used to distinguish between PD and NC. Brain Networks were used to identify PD patients and Control participants. Some researchers [1] explored PD and HC groups through Network Based-Statistics(NBS), they calculate brain connectivity matrices of all brains and directly compare average tract length and fiber volume. It is said that interconnecting fibers between cingulum, temporal lobe, frontal lobe are main sites of atrophy and damage. The main advantages of this method, announced by the authors, is the massive number of multiple comparisons. Nigro [39] shows that large-scale structural topological network changes the connectivity in motor(basal ganglia) and non-motor(limbic and olfactory). Some researchers shows the functional connectivity difference between early-to-mid PD patients and healthy participants by modular brain organizations [34]. Not only in the nucleus basalis, neurodegenerative changes also occur in a lot of other regions of cerebral white matter [48]. MD alteration in wide regions of white matter tracts were detected, and PD patients had diffuse deficits in the whole corticofugual tracts [30].(limitation-1)


% During the exploration of diseases in the past decades, people gradually found that neurodegenerative disease not only affect a specific region of the brain, but also spread to the whole brain\cite{olde2013disrupted}. Researchers find significant difference in whole-brain scale between healthy and unhealthy groups through neural networks analysis\cite{yau2018network}, network based statistics\cite{aarabi2015statistical} and DTI\cite{gattellaro2009white}. Meanwhile, many brain regions, such as putamen, palladum and cingulum, are reported to have great impact of neurodegenerative disease\cite{skorpil2012mri, hepp2017damaged, rae2012white}. Moreover, researchers point out that diffusion tensor measurements as well as fiber tract features can be used to distinguish disease brain and non-disease brain\cite{zhang2015diffusion, son2016imaging}. Many more other factors, such as age, gender, and race, may have great influence on neurodegenerative disease\cite{hirsch2016incidence}. Taking these factors into account，the size of features that can be extracted from the whole brain for disease analysis would be extremely large, which brings great challenges to find the most significant...

% It is crucial that different fiber tracking methods would provide different tractography results with the same DTI data [44]. With the difficulty and the uncertainties from getting consistent DTI to fiber statistics, researchers get contradictory findings while they are using different tractography methods. [63, 70].

% As announced by Wen [63], their study is the first to apply connecometry analysis to examine PD pathology. They find it that PD pathology affects not only substantia nigra (SN) region, but also some other regions, such as brainstem and callosal. They demonstrated increased FA and decreased MD and RD in those regions. Also, they find the negative relationship between FA and motor severity but positive correlations between MD and RD and motor severity in PD.

% However, on the contradictory, Zhang [70] find the FA value was on average reduced in PD patients in the region of nigrostriatal but MD and RD were increased. It is the earliest study on the variation of DTI measures in nigrostriatal tracts in PD. Cochrane [12, 50]
% also claimed that comparing with control groups FA value in SN was lower in PD group. Simultaneously, nigral FA changes reveals a significant decrease in PD group [53]. 

% Researchers also provide meta-analysis method to evaluate the structural brain changes associated with PD and find that DTI is particularly relevant for subcortical areas [4].

%  ----------------------

% Also, researchers [62] explore a diagnostic pattern to discriminate patients in two different PD neuro-pathological process and distinguish healthy subjects and PD patients by using DTI and ASL and identified optimal diagnostic variables by using five-fold cross-
% validation. Their research is based on the hypothesis that early PD and the severity can be identified by combing DTI and ASL. Though they are able to distinguish subjects by FA-SN value and other attributes, however, the distribution of the attributes and progressive
% effects of physical changes on DTI fiber tracts are still not well understood.

% The nigrostriatal and nigropallidal tract in the PD patient was sparser than that in the control subject [59]. Claassen [11] find a pattern of Parkinson’s disease that early left, late right hemisphere with posterior cortical atrophy.
