\section{Conclusions}

\noindent The system we introduce can effectively facilitate a deeper physical investigation into the statistical measures that are used by researchers to study differences between healthy control and neurodegenerative disease groups of DTI fiber tracts. The efficiency of the investigation is increased through intelligent guidance in the exploration process using predictive modelling, while comparative analysis is enhanced through customized interactive visualization views that are directly linked with each other and the predictive modelling pipeline. This set of views, with their encodings and interactions, help give better context to the observed differences, by simultaneously expressing multiple comparative modes for analysis and emphasizing uncertainty. This approach can benefit neurodegenerative disease researchers by helping them more easily gain a wide perspective into their data as they search for insights through an exploratory analysis process.

% further study 1: Though, our visual analytics system can help researchers discover some disease characteristics and deeper analyze the findings. A new methodology for automatically find the disease area and quantify the two subjects should be provided.
