% %The connectome and fiber reconstruction process for each brain took us on average about $7$ hours, for a combined time of $~35$ days of processing on a medium powered desktop PC.

% For the interactive predictive analysis, the feature selection process completes in about $2$ seconds on average, while the group-wise subject classification time varies considerably depending on the model used. With the number of features and subjects we used, SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression (the 3 highest performing models) were each able to be trained for each region and the full feature set, on average in less than $5$ seconds per cross-validation trial. This could be improved by training and testing the models for each region in parallel using separate python processes.
