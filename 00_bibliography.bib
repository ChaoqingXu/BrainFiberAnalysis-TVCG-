abstract = "In biospectroscopy, suitably annotated and statistically independent samples (e.g. patients, batches, etc.) for classifier training and testing are scarce and costly. Learning curves show the model performance as function of the training sample size and can help to determine the sample size needed to train good classifiers. However, building a good model is actually not enough: the performance must also be proven. We discuss learning curves for typical small sample size situations with 5–25 independent samples per class. Although the classification models achieve acceptable performance, the learning curve can be completely masked by the random testing uncertainty due to the equally limited test sample size. In consequence, we determine test sample sizes necessary to achieve reasonable precision in the validation and find that 75–100 samples will usually be needed to test a good but not perfect classifier. Such a data set will then allow refined sample size planning on the basis of the achieved performance. We also demonstrate how to calculate necessary sample sizes in order to show the superiority of one classifier over another: this often requires hundreds of statistically independent test samples or is even theoretically impossible. We demonstrate our findings with a data set of ca. 2550 Raman spectra of single cells (five classes: erythrocytes, leukocytes and three tumour cell lines BT-20, MCF-7 and OCI-AML3) as well as by an extensive simulation that allows precise determination of the actual performance of the models in question."

abstract = "Summary
Since 2006, several longitudinal studies have assessed environmental or behavioural factors that seem to modify the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Increased risk of Parkinson's disease has been associated with exposure to pesticides, consumption of dairy products, history of melanoma, and traumatic brain injury, whereas a reduced risk has been reported in association with smoking, caffeine consumption, higher serum urate concentrations, physical activity, and use of ibuprofen and other common medications. Randomised trials are investigating the possibility that some of the negative risk factors might be neuroprotective and thus beneficial in individuals with early Parkinson's disease, particularly with respect to smoking (nicotine), caffeine, and urate. In the future, it might be possible to identify Parkinson's disease in its prodromal phase and to promote neuroprotective interventions before the onset of motor symptoms. At this time, however, the only intervention that seems justifiable for the primary prevention of Parkinson's disease is the promotion of physical activity, which is likely to be beneficial for the prevention of several chronic diseases."

Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might contribute predicting cognitive decline in PD.Design/Methods: We enrolled 84 PD patients and 41 healthy controls. At study entry, all subjects underwent clinical and cognitive evaluations, and MRI including 3D T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Patients were followed clinically and neuropsychologically for 2 years and classified as cognitive progressors (from normal cognition to MCI, or from MCI to dementia) or non-progressors (stable cognition over two years). Measures of cortical thickness and WM tract microstructure were obtained by surface-based morphometry and probabilistic tractography, respectively.Results: Thirty-one patients were classified as cognitive progressors. Compared with controls, both groups did not show cortical thinning, non-progressors showed microstructural changes in the cerebellar peduncles, while progressors had alterations in corpus callosum, cingulum, corticospinal and peduncolopontine tracts. Progressors did not show significant cortical thinning compared to non-progressors. Conversely, they demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy of the body of the corpus callosum, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), bilateral middle cerebellar and superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP) bilaterally, and right uncinate fasciculus, and increased mean diffusivity of the genu of the corpus callosum, cingulum, ILF, corticospinal tract, SCP bilaterally, as well as left superior longitudinal fasciculus and right uncinate fasciculus.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of microstructural white matter alterations at baseline may be associated with the development or worsening of cognitive deficits in PD patients over two years.

Studies were included if reporting diagnostic parameters regarding clinical diagnosis of PD or crude data. The selected studies were subclassified based on different study setting, type of test diagnosis, and gold standard. Bayesian meta-analyses of available data were performed.Results: We selected 20 studies, including 11 using pathologic examination as gold standard. Considering only these 11 studies, the pooled diagnostic accuracy was 80.6\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] 75.2\%{\textendash}85.3\%). Accuracy was 73.8\% (95\% CrI 67.8\%{\textendash}79.6\%) for clinical diagnosis performed mainly by nonexperts. Accuracy of clinical diagnosis performed by movement disorders experts rose from 79.6\% (95\% CrI 46\%{\textendash}95.1\%) of initial assessment to 83.9\% (95\% CrI 69.7\%{\textendash}92.6\%) of refined diagnosis after follow-up.

The accuracy did not significantly improve in the last 25 years, particularly in the early stages of disease, where response to dopaminergic treatment is less defined and hallmarks of alternative diagnoses such as atypical parkinsonism may not have emerged. Misclassification rate should be considered to calculate the sample size both in observational studies and randomized controlled trials.

abstract = "Sporadic or idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder of unknown origin that ranks only second behind Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in prevalence and its consequent social and economic burden. PD neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta; however, more widespread involvement of other CNS structures and peripheral tissues now is widely documented. The onset of molecular and cellular neuropathology of PD likely occurs decades before the onset of the motor symptoms characteristic of PD. The hallmark symptoms of PD, resting tremors, rigidity and postural disabilities, are related to dopamine (DA) deficiency. Current therapies treat these symptoms by replacing or boosting existing DA. All current interventions have limited therapeutic benefit for disease progression because damage likely has progressed over an estimated period of ~5 to 15years to a loss of 60%–80% of the nigral DA neurons, before symptoms emerge. There is no accepted definitive biomarker of PD. An urgent need exists to develop early diagnostic biomarkers for two reasons: (1) to intervene at the onset of disease and (2) to monitor the progress of therapeutic interventions that may slow or stop the course of the disease. In the context of disease development, one of the promises of personalized medicine is the ability to predict, on an individual basis, factors contributing to the susceptibility for the development of a given disease. Recent advances in our understanding of genetic factors underlying or contributing to PD offer the potential for monitoring susceptibility biomarkers that can be used to identify at-risk individuals and possibly prevent the onset of disease through treatment. Finally, the exposome concept is new in the biomarker discovery arena and it is suggested as a way to move forward in identifying biomarkers of neurological diseases. It is a two-stage scheme involving a first stage of exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) to profile omic features in serum to discover molecular biomarkers. The second stage involves application of this knowledge base in follow-up studies. This strategy is unique in that it promotes the use of data-driven (omic) strategies in interrogating diseased and healthy populations and encourages a movement away from using only reductionist strategies to discover biomarkers of exposure and disease. In this short review we will examine 1) advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PD that have led to candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment efficacy and 2) new technologies on the horizon that will lead to novel approaches in biomarker development."

abstract = {Abstract We describe visual analytics solutions aiming to support public health professionals, and thus, preventive measures. Prevention aims at advocating behaviour and policy changes likely to improve human health. Public health strives to limit the outbreak of acute diseases as well as the reduction of chronic diseases and injuries. For this purpose, data are collected to identify trends in human health, to derive hypotheses, e.g. related to risk factors, and to get insights in the data and the underlying phenomena. Most public health data have a temporal character. Moreover, the spatial character, e.g. spatial clustering of diseases, needs to be considered for decision-making. Visual analytics techniques involve (subspace) clustering, interaction techniques to identify relevant subpopulations, e.g. being particularly vulnerable to diseases, imputation of missing values, visual queries as well as visualization and interaction techniques for spatio-temporal data. We describe requirements, tasks and visual analytics techniques that are widely used in public health before going into detail with respect to applications. These include outbreak surveillance and epidemiology research, e.g. cancer epidemiology. We classify the solutions based on the visual analytics techniques employed. We also discuss gaps in the current state of the art and resulting research opportunities in a research agenda to advance visual analytics support in public health.}

ABSTRACT={Alzheimer's disease (AD), including its mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase that may or may not progress into the AD, is the most ordinary form of dementia. It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24\% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification performance over the unimodal classification.}

This study aims at providing a personalized MCI-to-AD conversion estimation by using a multipredictor nomogram that integrates neuroimaging features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker, and clinical assessments. To do so, 290 MCI patients were collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), of whom 76 has converted to AD and 214 remained with MCI. All subjects were randomly divided into a primary and validation cohort. Radiomics signature (Rad-sig) was obtained based on 17 cerebral cortex features selected by using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm. Clinical factors and amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) concentration were selected by using Spearman correlation between the converted and not-converted patients. Then, a nomogram that combines image features, clinical factor, and Aβ concentration was constructed and validated. Furthermore, we explored the associations between various predictors from the macro- to the microperspective by assessing gene expression patterns. Our results showed that the multipredictor nomogram (C-index 0.978 and 0.956 in both cohorts, respectively) outperformed the nomogram using either Rad-sig or Aβ concentration as individual predictors. Significant associations were found between neuropsychological scores, cerebral cortex features, Aβ levels, and underlying gene pathways. Our study may have a clinical impact as a powerful predictive tool for predicting the conversion probability of MCI and providing associations between cognitive impairment, structural changes, Aβ levels, and underlying biological patterns from the macro- to the microperspective.},

abstract = "Parkinson’s disease is caused by the disruption of the brain cells that produce substance to allow brain cells to communicate with each other, called dopamine. The cells that produce dopamine in the brain are responsible for the control, adaptation and fluency of movements. When 60–80\%of these cells are lost, then enough dopamine is not produced and Parkinson’s motor symptoms appear. It is thought that the disease begins many years before the motor (movement related) symptoms and therefore, researchers are looking for ways to recognize the non-motor symptoms that appear early in the disease as early as possible, thereby halting the progression of the disease. In this paper, machine learning based diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is presented. The proposed diagnosis method consists of feature selection and classification processes. Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination methods were considered for feature selection task. Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines were used for the classification of Parkinson's patients in the experiments. Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination was shown to perform better than the other methods. 93.84\% accuracy was achieved with the least number of voice features for Parkinson’s diagnosis."

    abstract = "{Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia. Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent in Parkinson’s disease, with a 70\% cumulative incidence of dementia. The aim of this cross‐sectional study was to establish the pattern of cerebral atrophy on MRI in Parkinson’s disease patients with dementia. We used voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) to provide an unbiased means of investigating brain volume loss. Whole brain structural T1‐weighted MRI scans from Parkinson’s disease patients with dementia (PDD, n = 26), Parkinson’s disease patients without dementia (n = 31), Alzheimer’s disease patients (n = 28), patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 17) and control subjects (n = 36) were acquired. Images were analysed using SPM99 and the optimized method of VBM. Reduced grey matter volume in PDD patients compared with controls was observed bilaterally in the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and in the occipital lobe, the right frontal lobe and the left parietal lobe, as well as some subcortical regions. Parkinson’s disease patients without dementia showed reduced grey matter volume in the frontal lobe compared with control subjects. There was significant grey matter atrophy bilaterally in the occipital lobe of PDD patients compared with Parkinson’s disease patients. In addition, significant temporal lobe atrophy, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus was detected in Alzheimer’s disease relative to PDD. No significant volumetric differences were observed in PDD compared with DLB. Thus, Parkinson’s disease involves grey matter loss in frontal areas. In PDD, this extends to temporal, occipital and subcortical areas, with occipital atrophy in PDD being the only difference between the two groups. This provides important information about the pattern of cerebral atrophy in Parkinson’s disease and PDD.}",

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate gender differences in basic disease characteristics, motor deterioration and nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD). Methods: We studied 253 consecutive PD patients who were not receiving levodopa or dopamine agonists (disease duration ⩽10 years). We investigated the influence of gender and oestrogen status on: (1) age at onset, (2) presenting symptom, (3) severity and progression of motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III) scores) and (4) amount and progression of nigrostriatal degeneration ([123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography measurements). Results: Age at onset was 2.1 years later in women (53.4 years) than in men (51.3 years). In women, age at onset correlated positively with parity, age at menopause and fertile life span. Women more often presented with tremor (67\%) than men (48\%). Overall, patients presenting with tremor had a 3.6 year higher age at onset and a 38\% slower UPDRS-III deterioration. Mean UPDRS-III scores at disease onset were equal for both genders, as was the rate of deterioration. Women had a 16\% higher striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding than men at symptom onset and throughout the course of PD. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in women, the development of symptomatic PD may be delayed by higher physiological striatal dopamine levels, possibly due to the activity of oestrogens. This could explain the epidemiological observations of a lower incidence and higher age at onset in women. Women also presented more often with tremor which, in turn, is associated with milder motor deterioration and striatal degeneration. Taken together, these findings suggest a more benign phenotype in women with PD.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show early changes in white matter (WM) structural integrity. We studied the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing WM alterations in the predementia stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to DTI and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging data from 35 amyloid-β42 negative MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42−), 35 positive MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42+), and 25 healthy controls (HC) retrieved from the European DTI Study on Dementia. The SVM was applied to DTI-derived fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MO) maps. For comparison, we studied classification based on gray matter (GM) and WM volume. RESULTS We obtained accuracies of up to 68\% for MO and 63\% for GM volume when it came to distinguishing between MCI-Aβ42− and MCI-Aβ42+. When it came to separating MCI-Aβ42+ from HC we achieved an accuracy of up to 77\% for MD and a significantly lower accuracy of 68\% for GM volume. The accuracy of multimodal classification was not higher than the accuracy of the best single modality. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that DTI data provide better prediction accuracy than GM volume in predementia AD.},

abstract = {Knowing where people look and click on visual designs can provide clues about how the designs are perceived, and where the most important or relevant content lies. The most important content of a visual design can be used for effective summarization or to facilitate retrieval from a database. We present automated models that predict the relative importance of different elements in data visualizations and graphic designs. Our models are neural networks trained on human clicks and importance annotations on hundreds of designs. We collected a new dataset of crowdsourced importance, and analyzed the predictions of our models with respect to ground truth importance and human eye movements. We demonstrate how such predictions of importance can be used for automatic design retargeting and thumbnailing. User studies with hundreds of MTurk participants validate that, with limited post-processing, our importance-driven applications are on par with, or outperform, current state-of-the-art methods, including natural image saliency. We also provide a demonstration of how our importance predictions can be built into interactive design tools to offer immediate feedback during the design process.},

Functions such as interactive visualization, image registration, and model-based analysis are now being complemented by more advanced capabilities, most notably in neurological imaging and intervention. These functions, originally limited to offline use by technical factors, are integral to large scale, rapidly developing research studies, and they are being increasingly integrated into the management and delivery of care. This activity has been led by a community of basic, applied, and clinical scientists and engineers, from both academic and commercial perspectives. 3D Slicer, a free open-source software package, is based in this community; 3D Slicer provides a set of interactive tools and a stable platform that can quickly incorporate new analysis techniques and evolve to serve more sophisticated real-time applications while remaining compatible with the latest hardware and software generations of host computer systems.",

abstract = {Abstract Digital acquisition and processing techniques are changing the way neuroscience investigation is carried out. Emerging applications range from statistical analysis on image stacks to complex connectomics visual analysis tools targeted to develop and test hypotheses of brain development and activity. In this work, we focus on neuroenergetics, a field where neuroscientists analyze nanoscale brain morphology and relate energy consumption to glucose storage in form of glycogen granules. In order to facilitate the understanding of neuroenergetic mechanisms, we propose a novel customized pipeline for the visual analysis of nanometric-level reconstructions based on electron microscopy image data. Our framework supports analysis tasks by combining i) a scalable volume visualization architecture able to selectively render image stacks and corresponding labelled data, ii) a method for highlighting distance-based energy absorption probabilities in form of glow maps, and iii) a hybrid connectivitybased and absorption-based interactive layout representation able to support queries for selective analysis of areas of interest and potential activity within the segmented datasets. This working pipeline is currently used in a variety of studies in the neuroenergetics domain. Here, we discuss a test case in which the framework was successfully used by domain scientists for the analysis of aging effects on glycogen metabolism, extracting knowledge from a series of nanoscale brain stacks of rodents somatosensory cortex.},
